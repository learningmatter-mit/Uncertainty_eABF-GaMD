# Enhanced sampling of robust molecular datasets with uncertainty-based collective variables

Code for performing uncertainty-driven enhanced sampling using the extended system adaptive biasing force (eABF) coupled with Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD). The neural network (NN) architecture is based on [MACE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07697). The software is based on the paper "[Enhanced sampling of robust molecular datasets with uncertainty-based collective variables](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0246178)", and was implemented by Aik Rui Tan and Johannes C. B. Dietschreit.

### Code dependencies and installation

Please begin by installing PyTorch using the instructions on [their website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) for the device you are using and its corresponding CUDA version (if using a GPU). We have tested this repository with PyTorch v2.4.1 and recommend versions >2.2 and <2.6.

Once PyTorch is installed, you can run:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mace-torch==0.3.7 ase==3.23.0 numpy==1.26.4 scikit-learn skmatter
```

Finally, you will need to install `NeuralForceField` from the G&oacute;mez-Bombarelli group. Please follow the instructions on [that repository](https://github.com/learningmatter-mit/NeuralForceField) for installation with `pip`.

The approach for conformal predictions is developed from the [Amptorch code](https://github.com/ulissigroup/amptorch) from the Ulissi group at Carnegie Mellon University.
